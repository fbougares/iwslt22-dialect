i said let it be only one day
so you don't cook it for me i thought i would work for three days and come back
that's it
honestly ramadan is not for work honestly
you sleep at midday at one
you sleep at midday at one
you wake up i don't know that one who cooks and makes a lot of effort and all

i made it for a month that one would take me off
but the end of the month is over the end of the month and i still haven't finished it all
it's not even a week and it's over
two days it lasts for nine hundred dinars
once i tried it
the problem is on facebook
even if it doesn't cost me on the radio the problem is that they should be on their own because of the voice
i try to get away from them but it needs to work
and i hit the smell or did you leave it
because she
ah so
ah it's limited after eleven yes yes
they steal i think
yes i was watching my phone i put a movie and watching it again and i don't know what

%pw saturday because i leave from home on friday and saturday
on sunday i don't go out i mean for two days
two episodes

it would be more than two hundred and forty
you see more than two and two hundred and fifty dinars
you see two and two hundred and fifty dinars
less than them i mean one hundred and eighty dinars they give you an amazing eye and we don't hang up on you
do you understand do you add seventy dinars or eighty dinars
there's no phone on the neighborhood it's still now

i am not at first i am not getting hotter

then he went home and brought me emna my cousin %pw
i will go out with them because they come
hello yes hi are you fine
how are you doing i'm tired
ah what did you say
i told you i'm tired
me too i swear to god i didn't know i mean it's useless i woke up late and all so i slept
i didn't wake up fine and i will have to stay up late tonight
it's so boring and it's ramadan but it's not ramadan
it is tiring i swear it is so bad that day
that's it i saw you put photos of the group
you don't wear them
you don't wear them i told you you don't wear them
ah i got you yes
you know when you bought them not like you know when you bought them it's amazing i think they're amazing
now i gave you some of them
yes i got you yes
that's true so you want to sell them i got you yes
i bought one well it's not a secret it's like you get a fool
i took that one at that time you can hear about it
there are in tunisia mall
they have
no i got them in the sales i swear in the sales
in april or in april or in may you get it
i bought it for forty-five dinars you see
i will send you his pictures and then when you get him a kiss he is set up his hand but i put them on the side
i won't get the back from the side
look you see the top that one who takes his hand
and if you get a big amount it's a big gift it's a big bag it's a big bag you see put it on the top of it in the top of my bag
and they have two big big ones you see it's black but it's full it's full it's a gift i put them in a good shape
but he will take it on the side because there is something like that he can take it on the back but he doesn't believe me
he is the same brother i mean but he takes
i didn't believe it but he looks like it looks like a gift i took a look at that time i took the statistics exam on the fifth of the thirtieth or the fifth of the month
i didn't know about it asma woke up with it
i took it for thirty five if it is
i bought it for thirty five hundred dinars if the bag is on the twenty-ninth i took it to sneakers i think it costs a bit of sneakers
and a little bit not much and you know those old shoes of the ones before the ones with a little bit of the penalty
like that but in front of the front %pw a penalty you see
on the back it's normal white it's normal
his size is white and it has a bit white it's not the same as the pastries
it seemed to me it's not bad it's thirty five and everything
the bag is black the bag is black i naturally don't have a black bag in front you see
i mean i have that one that i want to change so it didn't fit me to buy a black bag
i don't know what it costs eighty dinars to find it
so i took i found this one in the same once a black bag is black and that's it
i mean if i am going to buy
me too yes
i was stuck because i go out during ramadan every night my problem is there isn't something beautiful on the top do you understand there are no many things on top
shoes and everything it's not a problem now
so much yes the shirts are like they are so much the ones are trendy
i bought five dinars for five dinars for five dinars to buy them and take them to the tailor to take them to the store
and a discount i said your shirt
it's not that i have a dress to do it like that
yes the kid is for three dinars and the old ones for five dinars
you get it and you get it you will have to start an internship to get it
that's good did you prepare them or have you sat for the tailor
but even when you spend the exam you'll have to retake them for a hot day
yes i didn't know about them i thought
it's better yes i thought it was a salad i didn't know about it
rim told me you know
and i still haven't brought her a shirt yet
i mean i already bought those three points and the other one is twelve and the other one
the other one that made me lose them i didn't get them i didn't see how they are
that's it listen do you want me to
because i bought six for one and then you get in it from sabri
i mean i ask you if you find a pair of trousers
it's expensive you know
he fell in the sales or the fifth
do you know it or not look what i was going to tell you what did i want to take it
asma only had one year last year one was a great one
i don't know what i took him once she took him and went to spend the summer i had a whole month and i take a whole month in the coffee shop
even a drop it doesn't fall down
it will be in the bag and they won't take a drop because there are many people who sell it and i don't know what they sell it i mean
i liked it naturally she likes it
and that's it so i had to get some of them
when i asked her and everything she told me that they were from the fifth they are only expensive
they were on the fifth and there are some color and some of them
it's not like the other one with rice it's better
she asked me i told her look she asked me to ask her so she didn't tell me so she lost three
one for me and the other girl for me and one to the girl the other girl the other one feels like you see
and i can't use it to sabri to see if you want me to see of course if you want otherwise
i will see with myself no and in addition to that i was thinking about the thing of water
i'm trying to ask about that thing imen i myself will pay twice
as we say the second month of the month and the second month and the second month will be on the end of the month because i'm going to be very expensive for imen
it's not a person that is you see
because the other girl is the girl the other one is in her name is she in her name
mine was in her class and there are already iman who has another option i only pay for the five months and i will pay for him for a month because it's too much
she beat her up but it was amazing he doesn't feel like it at all
so when i am going to write it on the second month and for a month like this
that's it no it's a good time i just told you that's it
yes yes like that it's hard
i don't take the exam i was naturally naturally the sun is so hot you can't find the one in the same time i said
i will take my money otherwise i won't get it
here i am i am a beautiful thing i wear it it's better
yes plus the one you find that she has a lot when you go there
you find them already are ready you send their pictures
that's it you don't know about buying
i always told you they didn't get tired of the rent and i'm serious
i no longer but you always eat something you see
that's it what can we do for your mother
and i want to buy something new on the top and i want to buy something in my feet you know that one feels like he doesn't have
listen ah what did you say
that's it it's sunday
fatigue
as usual on monday
it's hard yes
i actually bought the first time we bought the stuff that the money was on the top
so she is a child
so we brought them i told them please let me see what i have to do
i found i had a big deal and all those ones
they're not normal and they're not
i feel it's too much i get it
they bought new clothes i bought them
but i felt like they say a piece of things and they are not like those things i don't know those are normal things
i thought i'd find a solution
i liked them i mean they are so beautiful but when i get in the list
yes when they entered the list and i will see those ones that are old and everything i feel like i feel it's old
yes i want to buy those bags do you know them

because marwen did a bad thing
we're hanging around and marwen
and my aunt will make a cup of tea
yes you're right
they said they're going to get some pizza
they don't have money so he went to the name of her sister
i told them that we were going to make pizza i need money
they told them that i have a check with marwen
he told him listen he told him no a check or anything he told him how much do you want he told him seventy thousand
he took him out of our own pocket money
he gave him seventy dinars
he told him
from our nerves that's right there is a guy from our nerves now we get back to her after
yes
he didn't make it and he gave him seventy dinars
they took a treatment and he didn't give it to me he gave it to it
and marwen gave him seventy dinars he told him how
marwen is sleeping from four in the afternoon he is calling his father and tells him where are you
his father is in sousse he called him at four thirty he told him i'm going out from sousse call him at six he told him i am going out from sousse
at nine thirty i am going out from sousse at nine i am going out from sousse at nine and four i am going out from sousse and five i am going out from sousse anyway i am going out from sousse
marwen did like that he did like that he said that he was going to the house and found out
sabri turned out to be the house he was going to see how he was going to see how he was going to see how he was in front of marwen in front of the house
he did it with marwen and he was angry and told him here i am going to see him
and i will see what the language is
it was like they were playing a fight
he is calling he is calling he doesn't pick up
he is calling he doesn't pick up he is calling him he sends him messages my son in the end he told him bring me money
and no that's it no if
when we were sitting in the glass of the time you went to see him in france
did you go to the beach after you meet up in front of the house of the house
he does like that and marwen took a look and he took his hair to his hair and he didn't take care of it
he took his head and marwen and he left
do you understand all this is mr mr mr he's not angry with him he doesn't normally get angry
yes you're right in short i feel like i feel like the sixth grade she said that there is something in the story
there's something in the story we came to see you
i told him sabri i was going to beat you up and i will beat him
you see so call him and i wanted to prepare a problem on saturday without problems
i told him call him he came to the bakery
he was going to talk about it and he started talking about it and he was about to fix the story and he didn't do anything
it turned out to be with him in the car and he stayed outside and he stayed outside
so like that they were talking they went out they went out with a client that is what is it
the one and he is going to visit his father in la marsa
from the beginning you don't eat the story and everything he said
a house to sabri told him if the house is at home we won't go if mom is not in the house anyway we will go
they went like this to kill me i told him honestly don't get angry with me i told him honestly don't get angry with me anymore my friend they have a project and they have a project
do you understand yes it's obvious i told him not to get angry
he told me i don't know how he was his soul and he got mad at him
he did like that he picked up the phone and marwen told him where have you been he told him here i am at his mother-in-law's house
we'll go to the hospital he told him here i need you in front of me i need you to come
they left me in front of the car and left he told him we have nothing to do with aymen and we are going to go to the hospital
so why would he go to the hospital and we stay in the car to eat something
it's like this as usual you remember the story i told him about the story that i told him about the story of last year
the one that has to make it in the morning
yes i see and his face was pale and the wind was pale
he was doing it sabri i swear we have nowhere to do now when we have nowhere to get the topic why would we do this subject i swear to god where do we have to see his face
and told him go well you see
yes that's it so he can get angry and get angry
i mean what happened in the end
they want to do it i mean
what do you think about this language they do it with him
it's normal like that my kids are in a neighborhood
yes yes at four in the morning of the evening
really where
yes here i told you there are some pieces they make some pizza to make some pizza
that's it that's it what matters is that they did it honestly
i know the other one the other one is honestly not to that point
i i i put it in mourouj one
anyway honestly i put it in the bathroom
that's it that's it it's better that it's a hard time i do it
the other one the other one was talking about it and i don't care about them
that's it do you think that he is laughing he is so funny but honestly something is annoying
my brother is a man with him but honestly it doesn't work
you like it like that you like it you like it you like it
it doesn't come dude it's not normal for a pizza to make a little bit of his friend
yes yes yes

it's not logical i swear it's not acceptable it's obvious that marwan is the one who knows marwen the one who knows
yes yes he didn't come he has money he said what are they going to make some pizza
yes that's it it doesn't matter what a situation seriously
i swear it's crazy it's crazy it's not like that

and they make a fool i don't talk to him at all and sometimes
when my brother comes i get it i get it with him

he didn't get a good game if we didn't win this game
it will be more than i am telling him
i swear i swear to god i swear to god

well i wish you know where the strongest weather is outside
she brought it and she has the red one and she brought you the red one
what is his name the math exam

he said his wife said it's enough it's enough
because he quit press the phone
do you want him to be patient with his age it's enough you can't understand me
but i swear it's a pity it's a thick amount
but there is nothing new with nour he doesn't want to be able to get the mercedes i swear may god protect us
there is a hotel that is
i don't think it would be a bit difficult
but if he comes to sousse but he doesn't eat it i swear to god but he won't clean it up
yes and the main team is honestly a big team and they do a very beautiful team
and nour and nour i'll tell you that it's still small and he's still going to learn
it's not a fan of an appointment there
i swear it's true it's true but that's it one should be patient
we'll take a picture of our time
if i got rid of the exam we would have taken that one to him that one is the messenger of allah
or are you going to eat it
i swear to god it's a scandal it's a scandal
i still haven't seen it when i remember it i swear my brother is like i am telling you
